# DadBoard (React Edition) 😄

_The #1 place for your dad jokes – now rebuilt with React!_

DadBoard is a lighthearted, mobile-friendly joke app where you can fetch dad jokes, save your favourites, and enjoy a bit of cheesy humour with a classic drum sound. This is a complete rewrite of the original version using **React**, applying everything I’ve learned since the initial build.

## 💡 Why the Rewrite?

I originally built DadBoard with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. After completing a React course on Scrimba, I revisited the project with fresh eyes and a lot more knowledge. This rewrite gave me a chance to:

- Practice working with React components and hooks
- Improve the UI/UX with modern styling
- Simplify code and manage state more efficiently
- Expand functionality while keeping things fun and simple
